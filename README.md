# Adam's Personal OpenGraph image generator

This is a Rust project that generates custom OpenGraph preview images for every post on my personal blog at [127.io](https://127.io/).  It's not intended for direct use by anyone else, but I broke it out into a separate (public) repo so that I could more easily share the code as part of a blog post about how to generate OpenGraph images in Rust in general, and using Cloudflare Functions and WASM in particular.

If you want to use this for your own site, you should defintely read that post first, and then fork this repo and customize it to your needs.  Please do not just rip off my OpenGraph image template without at least changing the site name to be yours, to avoid confusing people and pissing me off.
